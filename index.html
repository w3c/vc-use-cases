    <p>
A <em>verifiable claim</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece
of information about an <a>entity's</a> background such as a name, government
ID, payment provider, home address, or university degree. Such a claim
describes a quality or qualities, property or properties of an <a>entity</a>
which establish its existence and uniqueness. The use cases outlined here are
provided in order to make progress toward possible future standardization and
interoperability of both low- and high-stakes <a>claims</a> with the goals of
storing, transmitting, and receiving digitally verifiable proof of attributes
such as qualifications and achievements. The use cases in this document focus
on concrete scenarios that the technology defined by the group should address.
    </p>

This document represents a concise but limited collection of use cases readers
should review alongside the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable
Credentials Data Model</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
The work on this document was carried out under tight time constraints due to
limitations of the W3C process and publishing deadlines. Under such conditions,
errors are unavoidable and some of the ideas presented here are incomplete.
The Working Group hopes that in the future, W3C process can be revised to better
support the dynamic nature of standards work in a more consistent way across
different groups.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
The Verifiable Claims Working Group at the W3C is developing standards for
expressing and exchanging "<a>claims</a>" that have been verified by a third
party and to make them easier and more secure on the Web.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
This document does NOT attempt to define an architecture for the support of
Verifiable Claims.  Instead it expresses the sorts of needs that real users have
that could be addressed through support for some sort of self-sovereign claim
environment.  It attempts to use terminology that is consistent with the other
deliverables of the Verifiable Claims Working Group (you can see the relevant
terms in Appendix A).
    </div>
    <section>
      <h3>Importance of this work</h3>
      <p>
Entities (people, organizations, devices) need to make many kinds of
<a>claims</a> as part of their everyday activities. As more and more of these
important activities move to the Internet, <a>entities</a> need to be able to
transmit instantly <em>verifiable</em> claims (e.g., about their location,
accomplishments, value, what-have-you). From educational records to payment
account access, the next generation of web applications will authorize
<a>entities</a> to perform actions based on rich sets of credentials issued by
trusted parties. Human- and machine-mediated decisions about job applications,
account access, collaboration, and professional development will depend on
filtering and analyzing growing amounts of data. It is essential that data be
verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
Standardization of digital <a>claim</a> technologies makes it possible for many
stakeholders to issue, earn, and trust these essential records about their
counterparties, without being locked into proprietary platforms.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Use case model</h3>
      <p>
This document presents an aggregate use case model, comprising Needs, Roles,
Tasks, and Sequences. Taken together, these models define the use cases that
the Verifiable Claims Working Group has addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
User needs define the problem space addressed by <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
User Roles specify the roles different <a>entities</a> play when interacting
with <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Tasks define the functions users can
accomplish, and sequences demonstrate how tasks might be realized, by
interactions between <a>entities</a> over time.
      </p>
      <p>
As with all models, this use case model is neither exhaustive nor complete. The
listed uses cannot capture all possible use cases. Similarly, the models do not
completely characterize the use cases represented. However, the combined model
is intended to provide specific, coherent guidance for the work ahead.
      </p>

    <h2>User Roles</h2>
    <p>
There are four roles supported by <a>verifiable credentials</a>: <a>Issuer</a>,
<a>Verifier</a>, <a>Subject</a>, and <a>Holder</a>.
    </p>
    <figure>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <dl>
      <dt>
Issuer
      </dt>
      <dd>
The <a>entity</a> that creates a <a>claim</a> and associates it with a
particular <a>subject</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>
Verifier
      </dt>
      <dd>
The <a>entity</a> verifying a <a>claim</a> about a given <a>subject</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>
Subject
      </dt>
      <dd>
The <a>entity</a> about whom a <a>claim</a> is issued.
      </dd>
      <dt>
Holder
      </dt>
      <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> may perform by possessing one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a>. A <a>holder</a> is usually, but not always, the
<a>subject</a> of the <a>verifiable credentials</a> that they are holding.
<a>Holders</a> store their <a>credentials</a> in <a>credential repositories</a>.

    <h2>User Needs</h2>
    <p>
<a>Verifiable credentials</a> address user needs in a number of key domains:

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p>
The education domain includes all levels of the educational experience; from
primary through professional continuing education.

<udef>E.1 Digital transcript</udef>
        </dt>
        <dd>
Joleen is the registrar of Mega University and, by virtue of her office, is
responsible for the integrity, accuracy, and security of academic records.
Joleen has been a pioneering registrar in advocating an "extended transcript"
that includes not only the standard set of course grades but also adds
supplementary information on learner competencies.  These might include work
experiences and non-educational but marketable skills. Upon the request of her
students, Joleen issues a digital credential that includes an extended
transcript.

<udef>E.2 Taking a test</udef>
        </dt>
        <dd>
Eunice is about to take her ACT (a test used to evaluate her readiness for
college). When she arrives at the testing center, she is required to present
identification. Her government-issued identity certificate is acceptable, as
the <a>verifiable credentials</a> contained in it reflect all of the required
attributes and it is difficult to counterfeit.
        </dd>
        <dt>
<udef>E.3 Transferring schools</udef>
        </dt>
        <dd>
Rocky is an undergraduate student at Wossamotta U.  His school provides a
<a>credential repository</a> service to all students and alumni, so he chooses
to use it. In his third year, Rocky decides to transfer to Moosylvania Tech.
They do not offer a service, but he does not want to continue to use the
service of his old (and now rival school) so he moves his <a>claims</a> to the
service offered by his bank without needing to have them reissued.

        <dt>
<udef>E.4 Online classes</udef>
        </dt>
        <dd>
In MOOC and other online learning systems, being able to reliably identify
participants is vital to ensure the individual evaluation and certification.
Nick is participating in a course online and takes a test. He is required to
provide his credentials to prove his identity before the test, and then to
allow the system to issue a <a>verifiable credential</a> regarding the
results of his test.

<udef>R.1 Address verification</udef>
        </dt>
        <dd>
Francis has found the perfect pair of shoes. When processing orders, Giant Shoe
Company wants to be certain that his shipping address is accurate (inaccurate
addresses are very expensive in terms of customer service). They offer a
discount for customers who make verifiable addresses available as part of the
checkout process. Francis offers his certificate and gets the perfect shoes for
even less than he expected.

June goes to her local beer and wine store to buy a bottle of wine. She submits
her identity credential that lets the liquor store owner know that she is over
21 without having to reveal her actual date of birth, her address, or her state
ID number.

        <dt>
<udef>R.3 Fraud detection</udef>
        </dt>
        <dd>
On a bright Sunday, Oskar remembers that he still needs to buy his wife a
precious gift for their wedding anniversary. However, he is acutely aware that
it is precisely in weekends that gangs set up fraudulent web shops that claim
to sell such gifts, while in fact they only take the cash, and disappear on
Mondays. So before actually purchasing a gift from the web shop of his choice,
he requests the shop to provide a credential issued by the chamber of commerce,
that contains proof of legitimacy. After having verified that the shop is
legit, he can purchase his gift.

<udef>F.1 Reuse know your customer</udef>
        </dt>
        <dd>
Jane is opening an account at MidBank in Finland.  As part of that process,
the bank asks her to provide two from a variety of possible sources to confirm
her identity &mdash; a so-called &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; check. She
selects government-supplied <a>verifiable credentials</a> that confirm she
receives postal mail at a certain address and that she has a national ID card.
Confirming these allows the bank to open her account and be confident in her
identity when she conducts transactions.
        </dd>
        <dd>
Now that the account is open, Jane is issued a digitally-signed
<a>credential</a> for her checking account at MidBank. This <a>credential</a>
verifies that Jane has an account at MidBank and has access to her associated
checking account. Since MidBank (and all banks in Finland) are required to
perform &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; checks on accounts, this credential
can also be used as sufficient verification by other financial institutions.
This can help Jane assure destination banks that she is verified, thereby
allaying concerns about misdirected transactions and money laundering.

<udef>F.2 Money transfer</udef>
        </dt>
        <dd>
Susan wants to send funds to her family in another country via a popular money
transfer service.  She has <a>verifiable credentials</a> in her
<a>credential repository</a> that can be used to share her
identity profile. She has also been sent a <a>credential</a> from her
family verifying their banking information. By sharing these with the money
transfer service, they can automatically verify the source and destination of
funds, thus being confident in the delivery of those funds and satisfying
various regulations regarding prevention of money laundering.

        <dd>
John opens a checking account at Big Bank Co and is issued a
<a>verifiable credential</a> indicating that the account exists, that the bank
verified John's identity, and that John has access to the account.  Some time
later, John is moving to a new city and decides to close that account.  Big
Bank Co needs to revoke that claim as part of their normal account closing
process.

Nikita has several accounts with BigBank, as well as a brokerage account with
WallStreetCo. She had placed all of her <a>claims</a> in a
<a>credential repository</a> at BigBank that came free when she opened her
accounts. WallStreetCo is now offering a new <a>repository</a> that has an
interface she thinks she will prefer. Nikita copies her <a>claims</a> from
BigBank into the repository at WallStreetCo to experiment with their service,
but continues to use the service from BigBank while she is testing.

Barney is a physician, and has recently become board certified in his state.
The state's board issues Barney a digital certificate confirming that he is
certified to practice medicine in that state.  Barney can now use this
certificate when writing prescriptions and referrals, thereby improving
accountability and verifiability.

iPharmacy receives a prescription for Bob electronically from a local clinic.
It includes a certificate about the physician that issued the prescription as
well as one about Bob. iPharmacy's system automatically verifies the ability
of the physician to write prescriptions, as well as Bob's insurance coverage.
When Bob arrives to pick up his medication, iPharmacy further correlates his
identity with the certificate, thereby improving the end-to-end accountability
of their system.

Tracy has a sore throat soon after moving to a new town. She finds a physician
through her health care network and goes in for treatment. She is a new
patient, so the clinic needs to know who she is and how she will be paying.
When checking in, she presents her <a>verifiable credential</a> that
demonstrates her identity and her proof of insurance. When the clinic submits
this to the insurance company, they can automatically ascertain that she
submitted her proof of identity and insurance to the provider and granted the
physician the ability to submit the claim for payment.

he is asked for proof of identity.  He provides a credential that verifies his
name and address, but elects not to disclose his marital status nor his social
security number, as those are neither requested nor required at this clinic.
He further marks the disclosure as expiring in 30 days&mdash;he does not want

Josie is a healthcare worker that has created a profile on a professional
social network to make herself readily available for new opportunities in the
workforce. She lists her employment history and credentials including degrees,
certificates, and digital badges. The website requests verification of her
credential <a>claims</a> in order for her credentials to be visible when she
posts messages. Josie authorizes the sharing of the relevant <a>claims</a> with
the website, and the site verifies them before allowing Josie to expose them.

"Freedom?" is an online forum that encourages free discussion about issues
controversial in Freedonia.  The forum allows users to register anonymous
accounts, but it also allows users to obtain badges based upon real-world
certifications. Paula has been certified as an aid worker, and wishes that
information to be marked on her posts.  She shares her certificate with the
forum, but limits it to only verifying that she is the <a>holder</a> of the
certificate, that she is the <a>subject</a> of it, and that she is an aid
worker.  In this way she maintains her anonymity in this controversial forum
while still being able to assist her fellow countrymen.

immigration officials can quickly and easily evaluate his suitability as a
visitor to their country. Once they are satisfied, they will automatically
add the details of this new visit to Tom's passport.

Thousands of people each year are displaced because of man-made and natural
disasters. Anoushka is one such, having been forced to flee her village along
with her mother and younger brother. They reach an IFRC center just across
the border in a relatively safe area, but with no documentation. Since the
government of her homeland is in turmoil, there is no way for the IFRC staff
to easily establish their identities. Fortunately, Anoushka had been issued
a self-sovereign proof of birth, attached to which is the proof of birth and
marriage for her parents. She is able to retrieve this because it is available
from many places often the Internet. Since it is verifiable, the IFRC is
comfortable vouching for them and resettling them in a safer area for the
duration of the conflict.

      <h3>Devices</h3>
        <p>
Intelligence devices are created and deployed so that they can interact with
other <a>entities</a> (people, organizations, devices). Establishing trust
and maintaining secure relationships with these devices is especially critical.

Bob, the director of production at HVAC Manufacturing, issues a
device-identifying <a>verifiable credential</a> (e.g. IDevID, IAK) at the
factory for an energy-saving fan controller IoT device.
            </p>
            <p>
Carol, senior quality engineer at Certifications Testing Lab, issues a
certification of specification-compliance <a>verifiable credential</a> to the
fan-controller device at the certification lab during the manufacturing
process.
            </p>
            <p>
When the fan controller is installed at the customer's office at Modern Office
Spaces, the controller's identifying <a>credential</a> can be verified by Sam,
IT technician, to establish the identity of the controller as part of the
on-boarding of the new controller. The controller's specification-compliance
<a>credential</a> is verified to demonstrate the controller's Energy-Star
compliance.

            <p>
As the fan controller leaves the factory, additional
<a>verifiable credentials</a> are issued by Vince, a systems engineer at VAR
Resellers, as he verifies the manufacturer's configuration matches the
<a>verifiable credentials</a> accompanying the device. He then installs a
software package specific to Modern Office Spaces needs and issues
<a>verifiable credentials</a> that establish evidence of possession by VAR
Resellers and the software additions Vince made to the device.
            </p>
            <p>
Finally, upon delivery to Sam, the end customer, the
<a>verifiable credentials</a> show that the fan controller has been securely
handled and contains the correct features and certifications.

<udef>D.3 Devices setup for operating autonomously</udef>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>
Sam, the new device owner, needs to trust the device originated from HVAC
Manufacturing and was handled correctly at Certifications Testing Lab and
installed with the correct software package at VAR Resellers. After Sam
verifies each of the <a>verifiable credentials</a>, he issues another
<a>verifiable credential</a> for fan controller #37 which includes assertions
relating to trust: device manufacturer model/version, software manufacturer
model/version, security versions of components TCB, and associated devices the
fan controller is authorized to interact with including thermostat-board-room.
            </p>
            <p>
The thermostat-board-room monitors room temperature. When the temperature is
too hot it switches the fan controller #37 on and later when the temperature
reaches a comfortable level, off. The device makes sure the control signals
from thermostat-board-room are authorized (namely, that Sam intended for
thermostat-board-room to control the fan controller).
            </p>
            <p>
Sam is concerned about the security of the smart board room. He configures
the autonomously interacting devices to re-verify device trustworthiness
attributes periodically by re-checking that the device originated from HVAC
Manufacturing and was handled correctly by Certifications Testing Lab and
installed with the correct software package by VAR Resellers.
            </p>
            <p>
Sam may update the device’s software occasionally during its lifetime. Even
though Sam is applying the update, VAR Resellers supplies the correct update.
The device ensures that only VAR Resellers is able to supply the updated
software image and that only Sam is able to apply the update.

      <h3>Citizenship by Parentage</h3>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
Sam wants to claim US citizenship because his mother is American. Sam has a
digital birth certificate from Kenya, where he was born while his Mother was
in the Peace corps. He also has a digital version of his mother's US passport.
Because his mother’s name changed between his birth and the issuance of the
passport, Sam also has a marriage license with her maiden and married names.
Sam is applying for a new passport from the US Secretary of State.
        </p>
        <h4>Distinction</h4>
        <p>
This use case is challenging because the mother’s name changed, by marriage,
between the issuance of the birth certificate and passport.
        </p>
        <h4>Scenario</h4>
        <p>
Sam’s mother emailed him the certificate, license, and passport as independent
<a>Verifiable Credentials</a>. He then creates a <a>verifiable presentation</a>
which includes those credentials, a statement of their relationship to each
other and his relationship to his mother. He then visits the US Secretary of
State website, creates an account, starts the application for a passport, and
uploads his new <a>verifiable presentation</a> as supporting evidence. After
processing the application, Sam is issued both a traditional passport and a
new digital passport.

          <li>
He is the child in the birth certificate.
          </li>
          <li>
The mother in the birth certificate, the person in the passport, the spouse in
the marriage license are all the same person.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Trust Hierarchy</h4>
        <p>
Sam is legally liable for his claim to the rights of citizenship. The state
department is on the hook for verifying the underlying credentials and Sam’s
<a>claims</a>, including correlating against any additional data they might
already have.

        <h4>Threat model</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Threat: Terrorist / Identity fraud.</strong> A bad actor could be
impersonating Sam to attain a passport. Of course, if a bad actor were to be
able to collect the required <a>verifiable credentials</a>&mdash;mother’s
passport, birth certificate, and marriage license, that actor has already
significantly compromised the system.

<a>claims</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Identity assurance based on the contents of the
<a>claims</a>, potentially with enhanced data embedded in the <a>claims</a>,
i.e., data not currently in passports, birth certificates, or marriage license.
For example, a biometric template could be embedded in the birth certificate
<a>claim</a> and that template could be used for interactive identity assurance
at the time of submitting the <a>presentation</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Threat: Exposure of private information.</strong>  By storing
potentially compromising information in <a>credentials</a> and sending them
over the network, we are increasing the attack surface for the <a>subjects</a>
of those credentials.
            <ul>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>claims</a> (once by issuer, every

<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>claims</a> uniquely for each

      <h3>Expert Dive Instructor</h3>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
Pat earned multiple diving credentials while living and working in Fiji and
Australia. Later, Pat is hired by NOAA as a Dive Instructor, which requires
that they maintain certification as an instructor with additional specialist
diver certifications in dry suit, night diving, and search and recovery. The
dive instructor certification is public record, but the additional specialist
certifications are private because they are for personal diving, not acting
as an instructor.
        </p>
        <p>
Part of Pat's job is logging the certifications of fellow divers during NOAA
sanctioned dives.
        </p>
        <h4>Distinction</h4>
        <p>This use case is difficult because:
          <ul>
            <li>
Certification in Fiji and Australia. NOAA relies on an international
certification agency, PADI, with relevance in multiple jurisdictions.
            </li>
            <li>
Each of these <a>credentials</a> is issued by different schools in the name
of PADI.
            </li>
            <li>
Each <a>credential</a> has an independent expiration cycle.
            </li>
            <li>
Pat grants NOAA permission (the capability) to validate future
<a>credential</a> status changes.
            </li>
            <li>
On each trip, Pat creates a certified log of all divers, effectively issuing
a <a>verified credential</a> about other <a>credentials</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Scenario</h4>
        <p>
When Pat applied for his job at NOAA, he provided <a>verifiable credentials</a>
issued by different dive schools licensed by PADI to do so. NOAA verifies
cryptographically that the certifications were issued by PADI-approved dive
schools and that the credentials were still in good standing by checking both
the certifications' *and* the dive schools' revocation services.
        </p>
        <p>
Upon accepting the job, Pat issues NOAA a revocable token that allows NOAA to
check the current status of all of his certifications &mdash; not just the
status of a single <a>verifiable credential</a>. After any specific
certification expires &mdash; and Pat renews it &mdash; NOAA's next check of
Pat's certifications returns the status of the renewed certification, not just
the status of the (now expired) <a>verifiable credential</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
When Pat takes a group of divers on NOAA sanctioned dives, he records the
<a>verifiable credentials</a> for each diver (which demonstrate their diving
certifications), creates a <a>verifiable credential</a> including those
<a>credentials</a>; he signs and archives it on his laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
When Pat retires from NOAA, he revokes that token and NOAA staff is no longer
able to monitor his non-public certification status.

    <h3>International Travel with Minor and Upgrade</h3>
      <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
Malathi is traveling internationally with her 8-month-old son, Anand. His
father, Rajesh, is staying home. Malathi has enough frequent flyer miles to
upgrade the ticket to first class.
        </p>
      <h4>Distinction</h4>
        <p>
This use case is difficult because:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
Current US passports do not establish explicit relationship between parent
and child.
          </li>
          <li>
When one parent travels with a minor, the other parent is required to grant
permission for the trip, thus implying guardianship or responsibility.
          </li>
          <li>
The DID or other Digital Identity system replaces the role of the notary in
the paper/physical world
          </li>
          <li>
Credentials must be coordinated between two verifiers (agent and airline) for
two individuals, and a digital coupon is used.
          </li>
          <li>
The relationship of the minor to the non-traveling parent must be established,
in order for the permission to be considered.
          </li>
          <li>
In the minor's passport case, the <a>subject</a> is not the <a>holder</a> of
the <a>verifiable credential</a>. The <a>holder</a> of the passport is a
parent, not the minor.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Scenario</h4>
        <p>
Malathi obtains permission from Rajesh stating she is allowed to take the baby
out of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
Prior to booking the trips, Malathi visits HappyAir.com to request an upgrade
to first class. HappyAir issues a <a>verifiable credential</a> redeemable for
a first class upgrade on an international flight.
        </p>
        <p>
She books the plane tickets through her travel agent who adds the lap child
to the ticket.
        </p>
        <p>
HappyAir verifies that Malathi has a signed statement from Anand’s other
parent stating that she may exit the country with him.
        </p>

      <h4>Verifiable Credentials</h4>
        <dl class="dl-horizontal">
          <dt>
Malathi's passport

      <h4>Verifiable Presentation</h4>
        <p>
Submitted to HappyAir, includes Malathi and Anand's passport, assertion of
permission, birth certificate and Frequent Flyer coupon.
        </p>

      <h4>Trust Hierarchy</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Malathi is liable for her claim of parentage as well as securing right to
admission for herself and her son at their destination (visa may be required).
          </li>
          <li>
Malathi and Rajesh are both liable for attestation of permission to fly with
Anand without the other parent.
          </li>
          <li>
Malathi is liable for the cost of her ticket and her son’s ticket.
          </li>
          <li>
The agency is liable for issuing valid tickets and for verifying the
credentials provided by the travelers.
          </li>
          <li>
The airline is liable for issuing tickets and, ultimately, fulfilling the
terms of travel
          </li>
          <li>
The airline is liable for accepting the upgrade coupons at ticketing.
          </li>
          <li>
The airline is liable for verifying the credentials in the birth certificate
match the credentials in the permission letter.
          </li>
          <li>
The check-in agent, TSA agent, and passport control at the destination are
liable for identity assurance at various points of travel, using information
contained in the <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h4>Threat model</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Threat: Stolen Key.</strong> Malathi steals Rajesh’s key in order to
fake travel permission. (Kidnapping her own kids and fleeing Rajesh.)
            <ul>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Rajesh could store his key with a trusted third
party, such as an attorney.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Rajesh could use a hardware wallet with pin or
biometric.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Rajesh could use a passphrase on his key
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Threat: Stolen Key 2</strong> Ticket purchaser has Malathi’s
<a>credentials</a>, impersonating her to purchase a ticket. This could enable
a third-party kidnapping.
            <ul>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Travel permission can be restricted to specific
date and or trip minimizing abuse potential.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Embed identifying characteristics or biometric into
the credentials so that verifiers can independently verify the <a>subject</a>
in front of them is the <a>subject</a> in the <a>credential</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Malathi could use a hardware wallet with pin or
biometric.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Malathi could use a passphrase on her key
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Threat: Exposure of private information.</strong> By storing
potentially compromising information in credentials and sending them over the
network, we are increasing the attack surface for the <a>subjects</a> of those
credentials.
            <ul>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>claims</a> (once by <a>issuer</a>;
every <a>verifier</a> gets the same encrypted blob)
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>claims</a> uniquely for each
<a>verifier</a>. This may leak usage data to the <a>issuer</a>, assuming the
<a>holder</a> must ask for a new, encrypted <a>credential</a> for each
<a>verifier</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Blind the <a>claims</a> uniquely for each
<a>verifier</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>presentation</a> uniquely for each
<a>verifier</a>. No issuer involved
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Threat: Stolen coupon</strong> Rajesh falsifies the upgrade coupon.
            <ul>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> HappyAir signs the coupon with secure credentials.
              </li>
              <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Travel agent verifies the coupon through a
distributed status registry, verifying it is still valid

    <h2>User Sequences</h2>
    <p>
The transaction examples in this section show basic ways in which
<a>verifiable credentials</a> might be used. They are not meant to be
architecturally constraining. Instead, they are meant to help illustrate the
basic way it <em>could</em> be done in a typical commerce situation. Again
&mdash; please remember that it is just an example, and should not be thought
of as the canonical way such a <a>claims</a> environment must be implemented.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h3>How a Verifiable Credential Might Be Created</h3>
      <p>
In this first example, a user will request a verifiable credential&mdash;a
confirmation of their identity. Consider this illustration:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img aria-describedby="claim_flow"
             alt="Verifiable Credential Creation Flow Description"
             style="display:block; margin:auto"
             src="uc-issuing-claims.svg" />
        <figcaption>Verifiable Credential Creation Flow Diagram</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
Expanding on these steps:
      </p>
        <ol id="claim_flow" title="Verifiable Credential Creation Flow Description">
          <li>
Jane asks her User Agent to help her get a <a>verifiable credential</a> about
her identity.
          </li>
          <li>
Her user agent connects her to a <a>credential</a> <a>issuer</a> that is able to
<a>verify</a> her identity.
          </li>
          <li>
The issuer examines her documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
They are satisfied, so the <a>issuer</a> generates a
<a>verifiable credential</a> for Jane that includes information about her
identity linked to their own trusted <a>credential</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The issuer delivers the <a>verifiable credential</a> back to Jane's User Agent.
          </li>
          <li>
Jane views the <a>verifiable credential</a> to ensure it reflects her requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
When she is satisfied, she instructs her User Agent to save the
<a>verifiable credential</a> so she can use it in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
The UA communicates with her <a>credential repository</a>, instructing it to
store the new <a>verifiable credential</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>credential repository</a> returns a list of the 
<a>verifiable credentials</a> it is holding for Jane to the UA.
          </li>
          <li>
The UA shows Jane her <a>verifiable credential</a> collection &mdash;
confirming everything she has available.
          </li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>How a Verifiable Credential Might Be Used</h3>
        <p>
In this example, a <a>holder</a> of a <a>claim</a> needs to use that
<a>claim</a> in a typical commerce situation:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img aria-describedby="vf-flow"
               alt="Verifiable Credential Usage Flow Diagram"
               style="display:block; margin:auto"
               src="example.svg" />
          <figcaption>
Verifiable Credential Usage Flow Diagram
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ol title="Verifiable Credential Usage Flow Description" id="vf-flow">
          <li>
Jane decides to shop on the website WinesOfTheWorld.example.com (merchant).
          </li>
          <li>
The merchant's site requires Jane be 21 years of age and requests (via a user
agent-supported API call) that Jane prove this.
          </li>
          <li>
Jane's user agent asks her <a>credential repository</a> for the proof.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>credential repository</a> shows Jane some <a>verifiable credentials</a>
it holds that can support her age claim (e.g., her passport, driving license,
and birth certificate).
          </li>
          <li>
Jane selects one of these, and authorizes that it be shared with the merchant.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>credential repository</a> returns the selected <a>credential</a> as a
response to the user agent-supported API call, which in turn delivers it to
the merchant.
          </li>
          <li>
The merchant's server verifies that the <a>claim</a> is valid and satisfies
the requirement.
          </li>
          <li>
The merchant redirects the user agent to the web site with appropriate
authorization.
          </li>
