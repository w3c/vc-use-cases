    <p>
A <em>verifiable claim</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece
of information about an <a>entity's</a> background such as a name, government
ID, payment provider, home address, or university degree. Such a claim
describes a quality or qualities, property or properties of an <a>entity</a>
which establish its existence and uniqueness. The use cases outlined here are
provided in order to make progress toward possible future standardization and
interoperability of both low- and high-stakes <a>claims</a> with the goals of
storing, transmitting, and receiving digitally verifiable proof of attributes
such as qualifications and achievements. The use cases in this document focus
on concrete scenarios that the technology defined by the group should address.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id='sotd'>
    <p>
This document represents a concise but limited collection of use cases readers
should review alongside the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable
Credentials Data Model</a>.

    <p>
The work on this document was carried out under tight time constraints due to
limitations of the W3C process and publishing deadlines. Under such conditions,
errors are unavoidable and some of the ideas presented here are incomplete.
The Working Group hopes that in the future, W3C process can be revised to better
support the dynamic nature of standards work in a more consistent way across
different groups.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
The Verifiable Claims Working Group at the W3C is developing standards for
expressing and exchanging "<a>claims</a>" that have been verified by a third
party and to make them easier and more secure on the Web.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
This document does NOT attempt to define an architecture for the support of
Verifiable Claims.  Instead it expresses the sorts of needs that real users have
that could be addressed through support for some sort of self-sovereign claim
environment.  It attempts to use terminology that is consistent with the other
deliverables of the Verifiable Claims Working Group (you can see the relevant
terms in Appendix A).
    </div>
    <section>
      <h3>Importance of this work</h3>
      <p>
Entities (people, organizations, devices) need to make many kinds of
<a>claims</a> as part of their everyday activities. As more and more of these
important activities move to the Internet, <a>entities</a> need to be able to
transmit instantly <em>verifiable</em> claims (e.g., about their location,
accomplishments, value, what-have-you). From educational records to payment
account access, the next generation of web applications will authorize
<a>entities</a> to perform actions based on rich sets of credentials issued by
trusted parties. Human- and machine-mediated decisions about job applications,
account access, collaboration, and professional development will depend on
filtering and analyzing growing amounts of data. It is essential that data be
verifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
Standardization of digital <a>claim</a> technologies makes it possible for many
stakeholders to issue, earn, and trust these essential records about their
counterparties, without being locked into proprietary platforms.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Use case model</h3>
      <p>
This document presents an aggregate use case model, composed of Needs, Roles,
Tasks, and Sequences. Taken together, these models define the use cases that
the Verifiable Claims Working Group has addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
User needs define the problem space addressed by <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
User Roles specify the roles different <a>entities</a> play when interacting
with <a>verifiable credentials</a>. Tasks define the functions users can
accomplish, and sequences demonstrate how tasks might be realized, by
interactions between <a>entities</a> over time.
      </p>
      <p>
As with all models, this use case model is neither exhaustive nor complete. The
listed uses cannot capture all possible use cases. Similarly, the models do not
completely characterize the use cases represented. However, the combined model
is intended to provide specific, coherent guidance for the work ahead.

    <h2>User Roles</h2>
    <p>
There are four roles supported by <a>verifiable credentials</a>: <a>Issuer</a>,
<a>Verifier</a>, <a>Subject</a>, and <a>Holder</a>.
    </p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <dl>
      <dt>
Issuer
      </dt>
      <dd>
The <a>entity</a> that creates a <a>claim</a> and associates it with a
particular <a>subject</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>
Verifier
      </dt>
      <dd>
The <a>entity</a> verifying a <a>claim</a> about a given <a>subject</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>
Subject
      </dt>
      <dd>
The <a>entity</a> about whom a <a>claim</a> is issued.
      </dd>
      <dt>
Holder
      </dt>
      <dd>
A role an <a>entity</a> may perform by possessing one or more
<a>verifiable credentials</a>. A <a>holder</a> is usually, but not always, the
<a>subject</a> of the <a>verifiable credentials</a> that they are holding.
<a>Holders</a> store their <a>credentials</a> in <a>credential repositories</a>.

    <h2>User Tasks</h2>
    <p>
Use cases are often used as a driver for requirements. While the users of
<a>verifiable credentials</a> have needs across many domains, the tasks
associated with those needs span the domains. This section summarizes those
tasks, as well as requirements related to the tasks, and maps the tasks and
requirements back to the associated needs.

It is worth noting that the <a>subject</a> may or may not be the same

      <h3>Verify Credential</h3>
      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>Requirement</dt>
        <dd>
          It is expected to be possible for a <a>verifier</a> to verify that the
          credential is an authentic statement of an <a>issuer's</a>
          <a>claims</a> about the
          <a>subject</a>. Verifiers MUST have the capability to
          cryptographically prove that a credential has not been tampered
          with since issuance (authenticity) and that the issuer continues
          to assert the claims as true (currency). 
          <br><br>
          To check authenticity, the issuer's verification method(s), such as
          a public key, must be discoverable from the credential itself. It
          is expected that the issuer identifier either is
          itself cryptographically verifiable, or that it can be used to
          reliably discover the cryptographic material necessary to confirm
          that the content of a credential has not been changed since
          issuance. It is understood that verification depends on the
          verifier's acceptance of the robustness of the cryptographic
          mechanisms used for testing authenticity and for discovering
          verification methods. An untrusted verification method cannot be
          relied upon for verification.
           <br><br>
          Verifiers must also be able to
          inquire about the current status of a credential without
          revealing to the issuer 
          <ol type="a">
             <li>The entity requesting that status</li>
             <li>The credential for which status is being checked</li>
             <li>The subject of the credential being checked</li> 
          </ol>
          Requiring that verifiers perform this status check
          is what enables issuers to revoke, suspend, or otherwise
          moderate the status of the credential.
          <br><br>
          Similarly, if a discovery mechanism is used to retrieve
          verification methods for a given issuer, verifiers must be able
          to do so without revealing unnecessary information to the issuer.
          <br><br>
          In short, it must be possible to fully verify a credential
          without leaking usage data to the issuer or anyone else. This
          is to avoid the so-called "phone home" problem.
          </dd>
        <dt>Motivations</dt>
        <dd>
          In many environments (such as order processing), information — such
          as a payer's address, citizenship, or age — needs to be
          automatically verified to complete the transaction. 
          <br><br>
          It MUST be possible to verify these in an automated fashion.

      <h3>Validate Claim</h3>
      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>Requirement</dt>
        <dd>
          It MUST be possible for a <a>verifier</a> to check whether a
          given claim is appropriate for a particular use. That is, given 
          a credential that is authentic and current, the verifier needs to
          interpret the claims in the context of their own 'business rules'
          concerning, for instance, which parties are acceptable authorities, and which
          cryptographic mechanisms are acceptable for what situations.
          <ol>
            <li>Is the issuer someone we know?</li>
            <li>Are the claims made by this issuer appropriate for this
            particular issuer's authority?</li>
            <li>Is the holder's presentation an appropriate use of the
            credential?</li>
          </ol>
          The first and second questions will be answered because either the
          verifier already knows the public identifiers for the issuers it
          recognizes for specific claims, or there is a discovery mechanism
          whereby verifiers can find appropriate issuers given their
          business requirements. 
          <br><br>
          The business rules may allow the use of certain credentials for
          specific situations, even when verification fails. For example, a
          suspended or expired professional license may be accepted by an employer as
          evidence of past experience without it being treated as a current
          qualification for roles that require that license. For this
          reason, current status (as part of verification) only deals with the
          status of the credential as maintained by the Issuer. Timeliness
          is the domain of validation.
          <br><br>
          It's important to note that the bounds of authority for a given
          issuer are specific claim types made by them and relied upon by
          others. While a region's DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles)
          or equivalent agency might be an acceptable authority for an
          individual's driving privilege, it should probably not be treated
          as authoritative for an individual's hair color or current
          address, even though DMVs regularly include such claims in
          today's driver's licenses.
          <br><br>
          Unlike verification, it may not always be possible to
          automate validation. Some use cases require human review before accepting
          a particular credential for a particular use. For example, a
          digital proof of age system might need a trusted human agent to
          visually compare the holder/presenter in real-space to a
          reference photo securely referenced in the VC, before accepting a
          credential as valid.
        </dd>
        <dt>Motivations</dt>
        <dd>
          Verifiers need to be able to apply their own policies and rules
          to the information they rely on to run their "business" (which we
          mean broadly, to encompass all activity focused towards a goal).
          <br><br>
          Given this need, any given VC might be verified but not usable in a
          particular situation. For example, a self-issued driver's license
          would likely not be acceptable for a car rental by most car
          rental agencies, even though the verification succeeds. 
          <br><br>
          Even so, in other cases, such as at a go-cart racing facility, it
          may be entirely appropriate to accept the name and image from a
          self-issued license for the purpose of leaderboards,
          announcements, and correspondence.
          <br><br>
          These business rules are entirely the province of the verifier. Only after
          satisfying their rules should a verifier rely upon a claim as an
          accepted fact for specific use.

    <h2>User Sequences</h2>
    <p>
The transaction examples in this section show basic ways in which
<a>verifiable credentials</a> might be used. They are not meant to be
architecturally constraining. Instead, they are meant to help illustrate the
basic way it <em>could</em> be done in a typical commerce situation. Again
&mdash; please remember that it is just an example, and should not be thought
of as the canonical way such a <a>claims</a> environment must be implemented.
    </p>
    <section>
      <h3>How a Verifiable Credential Might Be Created</h3>
      <p>
In this first example, a user will request a verifiable credential&mdash;a
confirmation of their identity. Consider this illustration:
      </p>

      <figure>
        <img aria-describedby="claim_flow"
             alt="Verifiable Credential Creation Flow Description"

             src="uc-issuing-claims.svg" />
        <figcaption>Verifiable Credential Creation Flow Diagram</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
Expanding on these steps:
      </p>
        <ol id="claim_flow" title="Verifiable Credential Creation Flow Description">
          <li>
Jane asks her User Agent to help her get a <a>verifiable credential</a> about
her identity.
          </li>
          <li>
Her user agent connects her to a <a>credential</a> <a>issuer</a> that is able to
<a>verify</a> her identity.
          </li>
          <li>
The issuer examines her documentation.
          </li>
          <li>
They are satisfied, so the <a>issuer</a> generates a
<a>verifiable credential</a> for Jane that includes information about her
identity linked to their own trusted <a>credential</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The issuer delivers the <a>verifiable credential</a> back to Jane's User Agent.
          </li>
          <li>
Jane views the <a>verifiable credential</a> to ensure it reflects her requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
When she is satisfied, she instructs her User Agent to save the
<a>verifiable credential</a> so she can use it in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
The UA communicates with her <a>credential repository</a>, instructing it to
store the new <a>verifiable credential</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>credential repository</a> returns a list of the 
<a>verifiable credentials</a> it is holding for Jane to the UA.
          </li>
          <li>
The UA shows Jane her <a>verifiable credential</a> collection &mdash;
confirming everything she has available.
          </li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>How a Verifiable Credential Might Be Used</h3>
        <p>
In this example, a <a>holder</a> of a <a>claim</a> needs to use that
<a>claim</a> in a typical commerce situation:

        <ol title="Verifiable Credential Usage Flow Description" id="vf-flow">
          <li>
Jane decides to shop on the website WinesOfTheWorld.example.com (merchant).
          </li>
          <li>
The merchant's site requires Jane be 21 years of age and requests (via a user
agent-supported API call) that Jane prove this.
          </li>
          <li>
Jane's user agent asks her <a>credential repository</a> for the proof.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>credential repository</a> shows Jane some <a>verifiable credentials</a>
it holds that can support her age claim (e.g., her passport, driving license,
and birth certificate).
          </li>
          <li>
Jane selects one of these, and authorizes that it be shared with the merchant.
          </li>
          <li>
The <a>credential repository</a> returns the selected <a>credential</a> as a
response to the user agent-supported API call, which in turn delivers it to
the merchant.
          </li>
          <li>
The merchant's server verifies that the <a>claim</a> is valid and satisfies
the requirement.
          </li>
          <li>
The merchant redirects the user agent to the web site with appropriate
authorization.
