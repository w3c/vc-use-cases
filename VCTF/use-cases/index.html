    A <em>verifiable claim</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of
    information about an <a>entity's</a> background such as a name, government ID,
    payment provider, home address, or university degree.
    The use cases outlined here are provided in order to make progress toward
    possible future standardization and interoperability of both low and
    high-stakes <a>claims</a> with the goals of storing, transmitting, and receiving
    digitally verifiable proof of qualifications and achievements.
    The following use cases focus on concrete scenarios that the technology created
    by the group should address.
    </p>
</section>

<section id='sotd'>
    <p>This document is an early version being used as an integration point for
    a variety of use cases assembled from throughout the industry.  As the document
    becomes more mature this status will be updated accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    The Verifiable Claims Task Force at the W3C is investigating
    the requirements around secure, verifiable, and richly descriptive
    "<a>claims</a>".  The goal of the Task Force is to determine if
    there is a sufficient understanding and need to merit the creation
    of a W3C Working Group to develop Recommendations in this space.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
        This document does NOT attempt to define an architecture for
        the support of Verifiable Claims.  Having said that, its very
        structure reflects some assumptions about how claims might be
        used in the real world.  These assumptions are
        derived from the use cases, not vice-versa.  Any solution that
        satisfies the complete collection of essential use cases would
        meet the requirements reflected by this document.
    </div>
    <section>
        <h3>Importance of this Work</h3>

        <p>People need to make many kinds of claims as part of their
        everyday lives.
        As more important business moves to the Internet, people need
        to be able to transmit instantly <em>verifiable</em> claims about their
        accomplishments and qualifications. From educational records
        to payment account access, the next generation of web
        applications will authorize users to perform actions based on
        rich sets of credentials issued by trusted parties.
        Human-mediated decisions about job applications, collaboration
        and professional development will depend on filtering and
        analyzing growing amounts of data about individuals'
        experience and accomplishments.
        </p>
        <p>Standardization of digital <a>claim</a> technologies makes it
        possible for many stakeholders to issue, earn, and trust these
        essential records about their counterparties, without being
        locked into proprietary platforms.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>How to Read This Document</h3>
        <p>First, review the basic terminology used in section 2. This will give
        you a good foundation for understanding the rudimentary examples of how 
        claims might be
        issued and later verified in section 3.</p>
        <p>Finally, review the detailed requirements and supporting scenarios in
        Section 4.  There are also a significant number of "Extended Use Cases" in
        Appendix A.  We expect these are important, but possibly could be dealt
        with in subsequent phases of work.</p>
        <p class="note">The use cases in this document are organized around the basic operations that
        might be performed on a Verifiable Claim.  For each of these
        operations, 
        the document captures some high level use cases
        grouped by the requirement they represent.
        Each use case contains information about its motivation, relative
        priority, and one or more examples to help define the target
        beneficiaries of its support.

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>These examples describe basic ways in which Verifiable Claims 
    might be used.  They are not meant to be architecturally constraing. Instead,
    they are meant to help illustrate the basic way it <em>could</em> be done in a
    typical commerce situation.
    Again - please remember that it is just an
    example, and should not be thought of as the canonical way such
    a claims environment must be implemented.</p>
    <section>
        <h2>How a Verifiable Claim Might be Created</h2>
        <p>In this first example, a user will request a Verifiable Claim - a
        confirmation of their identity. Consider this illustration:</p>

        <img alt='Verifiable Claim Creation Flow Description' style='display:block; margin:auto' src="uc-issuing-claims.svg"/>
        <p>Expanding on these steps:</p>
        <ol title="Verifiable Claim Creation Flow Description">
            <li>[[XHTML1]]Jane asks her User Agent to help her get a Verifiable Claim about
            her identity.</li>
            <li>Her user agent connects her to a Certifying Authority that is able
            to verify her identity.</li>
            <li>The CA examimes her documentation.</li>
            <li>They are satisfied, so the CA generates a Verifiable Claim for
            Jane that includes information about her identity linked to their
            own trusted <em>credential</em>.</li>
            <li>The CA delivers the credential back to Jane's User Agent.</li>
            <li>Jane views the credential to ensure it reflects he
            requirements.</li>
            <li>When she is satisfied, she instructs her User Agent to save the
            Verifiable Claim so she can use it in the future.</li>
            <li>The UA communicates with her <a>Credential Curator</a>,
            instructing it to store the new claim.</li>
            <li>The <a>Credential Curator</a> returns a list of the claims it is
            holding for Jane to the UA.</li>
            <li>The UA shows Jane her claim collection - confirming 
            everything she has available.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>How a Verifiable Claim Might be Used</h2>
    <p>This sub-section
    illustrates a simple example of how a claim might be used in a
    typical commerce situation.  Please remember that it is just an
    example, and should not be thought of as the canonical way such
    a system must be implemented.  First, consider this diagram:</p>
    <img aria-describedby="vf-flow" alt='Verifiable Claim Usage Flow Diagram' style='display:block; margin:auto' src="example.svg"/>
    <ol title="Verifiable Claim Usage Flow Description" id="vf-flow">
        <li>Jane decides to shop on the web site
        WinesOfTheWorld.example.com (merchant).</li>
        <li>The merchant's site requires Jane be 21 years of age and
        requests Jane prove this (via a user agent-supported API call).</li>
        <li>Jane's user agent asks her <a>credential curator</a> for the
        proof.</li>
        <li>The <a>credential curator</a> shows her three Verifiable Claims
        it knows of that
        can assert this claim (e.g., her passport, driving
        license, and birth certificate).</li>
        <li>Jane selects one of these and authorizes that it be
        shared with the merchant.</li>
        <li>The <a>credential curator</a> returns the selected claim as a response
        to the user agent-supported API call, which in turn delivers
        it to the merchant.</li>
        <li>The merchant's server verifies that the claim is valid
        and satisfies the requirement.</li>
        <li>The merchant redirects the user agent to the web site
        with appropriate authorization.</li>

        <!-- commented out by @halindrome - not appropriate in the use cases
        section
        <p>The general flow discussed for issuing claims is the following:</p>

        <p><em><strong>Issuer Advertises Credential template</strong></em></p>

        <p>The <a>Issuer</a> publishes a <a>Credential</a> template elaborating
        on the requirements that must be completed to issue the
        credential.</p>

        <p>The credential definition includes descriptive metadata about the
        circumstances and context in which the credential is issued to the
        recipient (<a>holder</a>). The issuer clearly defines this information
        so others who later <a data-lt="credential consumer">consume</a> the
        credential can understand the context behind it.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Recipient Proves Suitability for Credential</strong></em></p>

        <p>A recipient (<a>entity</a>) proves that they have met the requirements necessary
        to acquire the <a>credential</a> from the <a>issuer</a>.</p>

        <p class="note">Credentials should be able to be issued as a side-effect
        of performing a particular real-world action.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Issuer Issues Credential to Holder</strong></em></p>

        <p>The <a>issuer</a> creates the credential for a particular
        <a>holder</a> containing one or more <a>claims</a> along with a
        <a>digital signature</a>. Issuers MUST verify the identity of the
        holder before issuing a credential if the credential makes claims about
        the holder.</p>

        <p class="note">Personally identifiable information must use known data fields
        in order to enable credential curation services to protect the
        recipient’s privacy.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Holder Stores Credential</strong></em></p>

        <p>The <a>holder</a> stores the <a>credential</a> with a <a>credential service</a> or
        other long-term storage location. A holder of a credential
        MAY store it on a variety of platforms or media. Credentials MUST be
        portable between <a>credential services</a>.</p>

                    requirements e.g., “I have maintained my profession by

                  a user using our system is the same person who registered for

                  Credentialing in both cases is critical and uncontrolled by

                  system to Know Your Customer” (KYC) and other profile

                  in ACH its “I am John Doe, and here is my account

                  ACH is just a set of rails, with no authentication beyond RTA

                <p>Purpose  The Country Government does not want to build a

                such as contact details and perhaps other claimed attributes
                such as partner’s name, etc. Alternatively, the objective is to
                support the marketplace to develop an ecosystem of local or
                global providers that offer the citizen a range of options to
                choose from. A standard could enable an approach that would
                remove dependence on any particular technology or platform as
                the choice of repository for an individual’s self-asserted
                profile – for example, personal mobile device, open cloud
                service, commercial provider website.</p>

                <p>Agency and citizen requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The government agency requires an applicant’s
                    contact details – that is self-asserted credentials; for
                    example, email address, mobile phone, postal address, to
                    complete their registration process for the agency’s online
                    service.</li>
                    <li>If the customer changes one of these attributes,
                    the agency would like the option of being notified.</li>
                    <li>The citizen wants the means to select specific contact
                    details from their existing self-managed profile to share with
                    this particular government agency.</li>
                    <li>If the citizen changes one of these attributes they
                    want to be able to simply update their profile without
                    explicitly notifying each government agency or
                    organisation.</li>
                </ul>

                <dd>Company is involved in the issuance and consumption of
                credentials as “social currency” to prove reputation and
                ascertain privilege on the Web. A credential is defined as
                a digitally signed data document that represents
                authoritative claims issued by primary source data
                providers to an entity (i.e., person, place or
                thing.). First major use case: An example would be a
                nursing license issued by a government agency. The holder
                of a nursing license credential can offer it via their
                browser to a web site as proof of required attributes. For
                instance, if a web site requires a visitor to hold nursing
                license to gain access, the site would request the nursing
                identity credential from the visitor’s IdP to authenticate
                the visitor by inspecting and verifying the provided
                credential status and authenticity. The nurse should be
                able to keep private the use of the web site from the
                IdP. Second major use case: Prior to filling and handing
                over a prescription to a patient, a pharmacy needs to:
                ensure the doctor’s credentials are valid and none of them
                violate a business rule; that the prescription data has
                not been tampered with; and authenticate the person
                picking up the prescription is or is appropriately
                associated with or an official proxy of the patient. Using
                digital credentials, these processes can be largely
                automated and streamlined. For example, when a doctor who
                writes a prescription, a digitally-signed credential can
                be generated that contains the prescription and an
                identifier for the intended patient. Linked to the
                credential can be another credential that contains the
                doctor’s License, DEA Registration, National Provider
                Identifier (NPI), Medicare/Medicaid Enrollment Status and
                Exclusion/Debarment status. The patient can be issued a
                credential that can be used to prove they are associated
                with the identifier. The pharmacy prescription system can
                now independently verify all of the above via these
                digital credentials at the point of sale terminal or even
                over the Web.</dd>

                <dd>Age-restricted consumer products companies (CPGs) have
                largely been excluded from price-reduced promotions – a
                $500B market in the US - to targeted consumers largely due
                to the requirement to ensure the promotion does not
                encourage under-age sales.  Digital identity can provide
                value to the consumer, CPG and merchant by opening up this
                currently closed market to age-restricted sales.  A beer
                brewer wants to provide a digital promotion to an ‘of age’
                consumer.  To obtain the promotion on their mobile, the
                consumer must prove their age to the beer company (so as
                not to run afoul of age laws) to obtain the promotion
                token.  Proof of age must be digital and tokenized,
                incorporated within the mobile device, and validated by a
                trusted service provider.  Upon validation of age, the
                brewer issues the promotion to the mobile, ideally with
                the age verification token embedded in the promotion token
                (for validation at POS).  The consumer then selects the
                promoted product at the convenience store, which is
                scanned at the POS.  The consumer elects to apply the
                promotion and passes BOTH the promotion token and age
                verification token to the POS which matches tokens.  With
                a successful match, the promotion is applied to the sale
                and price is discounted.  The store then ‘settles’ the
                promotion with the brewer; seeking payment from the
                brewer, retiring the promotion token and posting proof
                that age verification was assured for proof with
                regulatory agencies.  This same process – minus the token
                – can be applied in all age-validated sales within a
                convenience store; reducing or eliminating the store’s
                liability to under-age sales and keeping age-restricted
                products out of the hands of youth</dd>
                <dd>I think there are two use cases that would be
                important to Company.  The first is when verifying that
                new users are who they say they are.  We require that all
                users have a <a href="http://company.com">company.com</a>
                account in order to shop with us, so that either results
                in a returning user signing in or a new user creating an
                account.  It would be good to have the ability to verify
                with a credentials solution that the customer signing up
                with us was who they say they were.  The second case is
                relative to selling restricted items.  If we had a good
                way to validate a customer was qualified to purchase that
                restricted item with us then I think that could eliminate
                a good deal of friction from the process.</dd>
                <dd>We see a need for analyzing a bundle of credentials to
                help match or qualify a person for educational, workforce,
                and personal opportunities.  Doing so requires that the
                credentials meet the needs for our use case mentioned
                above in Question 4 and that the credential ecosystem can
                live on the web and within the web’s linked data standards
                and methods of data and privacy protection, security,
                sharing, and consumption.  We need credentials to be part
                of the web ecosystem to keep us from having to develop
                independent systems and applications for managing
                credentials.</dd>

                <dd>We do promote the use of LEI, the Legal Entity

                know which account to assign which user, especially if

                a certification course.
                The claim was issued by the course provider - Bob's School o' Programming.
                The employer's system looks at the claim, but is not familiar with the issuer.
                The issuer has included a URI for their own Verifiable Claim in the certification,
                and the employer's system retrieves that.
                The issuer's claim was issued by "Big Computer Corporation", a multi-national that
                the employer's system <em>is</em> familiar with.
                The system decides that it can trust the issuer, and therefore Jim's Verifiable
                Claim.</dd>
                <dd>Big Testing Service (BTS) provides online test management for a large collection of
                training organizations - connecting those organizations to various online testing
                providers and capturing test results. Systems such as LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability)
                can be used by BTS to certify that they are who they are, and the
                online testing providers are who they claim to be.  Unfortunately, LTI does not
                extend to the tire of BTS' clients, nor to the end users who are taking the tests.
                Organizations outside of that
                community need a way to know that Verifiable Claims issued by BTS and their clients
                are valid.  Endorsement of the BTS claims by the online testing providers, and
                endorsement of BTS clients by BTS, helps establish the trusted relationship.</dd>
