    A <em>verifiable claim</em> is a qualification, achievement, quality, or piece of
    information about an <a>entity's</a> background such as a name, government ID,
    payment provider, home address, or university degree.
    The use cases outlined here are provided in order to make progress toward
    possible future standardization and interoperability of both low and
    high-stakes <a>claims</a> with the goals of storing, transmitting, and receiving
    digitally verifiable proof of attributes such as qualifications and achievements.
    The use cases in this document focus on concrete scenarios that the technology defined
    by the group should address.
    </p>
</section>

<section id='sotd'>
    <p>This document represents a concise but limited collection of use cases readers should review in
    conjunction with the proposed Charter for a Verifiable Claims Working Group.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <!-- Editor - @halindrome -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    The Verifiable Claims Task Force of the Web Payments Interest and
    Credentials COmmunity Groups at the W3C is investigating
    the requirements around secure, verifiable, and richly descriptive
    "<a>claims</a>".  The goal of the Task Force is to determine if
    there is a sufficient understanding and need to merit the creation
    of a W3C Working Group to develop Recommendations in this space.
    </p>
    <div class="note">
        This document does NOT attempt to define an architecture for
        the support of Verifiable Claims.  Having said that, its very
        structure reflects some assumptions about how claims might be
        used in the real world.  These assumptions are
        derived from the use cases, not vice-versa.  Any solution that
        satisfies the complete collection of essential use cases would
        meet the requirements reflected by this document.
    </div>
    <section>
        <h3>Importance of this Work</h3>

        <p>People need to make many kinds of claims as part of their
        everyday lives.
        As more important business moves to the Internet, people need
        to be able to transmit instantly <em>verifiable</em> claims about their
        accomplishments and qualifications. From educational records
        to payment account access, the next generation of web
        applications will authorize users to perform actions based on
        rich sets of credentials issued by trusted parties.
        Human-mediated decisions about job applications, collaboration,
        and professional development will depend on filtering and
        analyzing growing amounts of data about individuals'
        experience and accomplishments.
        </p>
        <p>Standardization of digital <a>claim</a> technologies makes it
        possible for many stakeholders to issue, earn, and trust these
        essential records about their counterparties, without being
        locked into proprietary platforms.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>How to Read This Document</h3>
        <p>First, review the basic terminology used in section 2. This will give
        you a good foundation for understanding the rudimentary examples 
        in section 3.</p>
        <p>Next, take a look at the examples in section 3 to get a feel for the vision of
        how claims might be exposed and used in typical web exchanges.</p>
        <p>Finally, review the detailed requirements and supporting scenarios in
        Section 4.</p>
        <p class="note">There are also a significant number of "Extended Use Cases" that have been
        developed by the Credentials Community Group.  These are available in their living use case
        document [[CCG-USE-CASES]].  A review of these is not required, but may give the reader a
        better sense of the broad ecosystem the Credentials Community Group envisions.</p>
        <p class="note">The use cases in this document are organized around some of the basic operations that
        might be performed on a Verifiable Claim.  For each of these
        operations, 
        the document captures some high level use cases
        grouped by the requirement they represent.
        Each use case contains information about its motivation, relative
        priority, and one or more scenarios to help define the target
        beneficiaries of its support.

    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p>These examples describe basic ways in which Verifiable Claims 
    might be used.  They are not meant to be architecturally constraining. Instead,
    they are meant to help illustrate the basic way it <em>could</em> be done in a
    typical commerce situation.
    Again - please remember that it is just an
    example, and should not be thought of as the canonical way such
    a claims environment must be implemented.</p>
    <section>
        <h2>How a Verifiable Claim Might be Created</h2>
        <p>In this first example, a user will request a Verifiable Claim - a
        confirmation of their identity. Consider this illustration:</p>

        <img alt='Verifiable Claim Creation Flow Description' style='display:block; margin:auto' src="uc-issuing-claims.svg"/>
        <p>Expanding on these steps:</p>
        <ol title="Verifiable Claim Creation Flow Description">
            <li>Jane asks her User Agent to help her get a Verifiable Claim about
            her identity.</li>
            <li>Her user agent connects her to a Certifying Authority that is able
            to verify her identity.</li>
            <li>The CA examines her documentation.</li>
            <li>They are satisfied, so the CA generates a Verifiable Claim for
            Jane that includes information about her identity linked to their
            own trusted <em>credential</em>.</li>
            <li>The CA delivers the credential back to Jane's User Agent.</li>
            <li>Jane views the credential to ensure it reflects her
            requirements.</li>
            <li>When she is satisfied, she instructs her User Agent to save the
            Verifiable Claim so she can use it in the future.</li>
            <li>The UA communicates with her <a>Credential Curator</a>,
            instructing it to store the new claim.</li>
            <li>The <a>Credential Curator</a> returns a list of the claims it is
            holding for Jane to the UA.</li>
            <li>The UA shows Jane her claim collection - confirming 
            everything she has available.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>How a Verifiable Claim Might be Used</h2>
        <p>In this example, a <a>holder</a> of a claim needs to use that claim in a
        typical commerce situation:</p>
        <img aria-describedby="vf-flow" alt='Verifiable Claim Usage Flow Diagram' style='display:block; margin:auto' src="example.svg"/>
        <ol title="Verifiable Claim Usage Flow Description" id="vf-flow">
            <li>Jane decides to shop on the web site
            WinesOfTheWorld.example.com (merchant).</li>
            <li>The merchant's site requires Jane be 21 years of age and
            requests Jane prove this (via a user agent-supported API call).</li>
            <li>Jane's user agent asks her <a>credential curator</a> for the
            proof.</li>
            <li>The <a>credential curator</a> shows Jane three Verifiable Claims
            it knows of that
            can assert this claim (e.g., her passport, driving
            license, and birth certificate).</li>
            <li>Jane selects one of these and authorizes that it be
            shared with the merchant.</li>
            <li>The <a>credential curator</a> returns the selected claim as a response
            to the user agent-supported API call, which in turn delivers
            it to the merchant.</li>
            <li>The merchant's server verifies that the claim is valid
            and satisfies the requirement.</li>
            <li>The merchant redirects the user agent to the web site
            with appropriate authorization.</li>

        <h2>Issuing Claims</h2>

        <!-- commented out by @halindrome - not appropriate in the use cases
        section
        <p>The general flow discussed for issuing claims is the following:</p>

        <p><em><strong>Issuer Advertises Credential template</strong></em></p>

        <p>The <a>Issuer</a> publishes a <a>Credential</a> template elaborating
        on the requirements that must be completed to issue the
        credential.</p>

        <p>The credential definition includes descriptive metadata about the
        circumstances and context in which the credential is issued to the
        recipient (<a>holder</a>). The issuer clearly defines this information
        so others who later <a data-lt="credential consumer">consume</a> the
        credential can understand the context behind it.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Recipient Proves Suitability for Credential</strong></em></p>

        <p>A recipient (<a>entity</a>) proves that they have met the requirements necessary
        to acquire the <a>credential</a> from the <a>issuer</a>.</p>

        <p class="note">Credentials should be able to be issued as a side-effect
        of performing a particular real-world action.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Issuer Issues Credential to Holder</strong></em></p>

        <p>The <a>issuer</a> creates the credential for a particular
        <a>holder</a> containing one or more <a>claims</a> along with a
        <a>digital signature</a>. Issuers MUST verify the identity of the
        holder before issuing a credential if the credential makes claims about
        the holder.</p>

        <p class="note">Personally identifiable information must use known data fields
        in order to enable credential curation services to protect the
        recipient’s privacy.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Holder Stores Credential</strong></em></p>

        <p>The <a>holder</a> stores the <a>credential</a> with a <a>credential service</a> or
        other long-term storage location. A holder of a credential
        MAY store it on a variety of platforms or media. Credentials MUST be
        portable between <a>credential services</a>.</p>

                  Credentialing in both cases is critical and uncontrolled by

                  ACH is just a set of rails, with no authentication beyond RTA

                When processing orders, Giant Shoe Company wants to be certain
                that his shipping address is accurate (inaccurate
                addresses are very expensive in terms of customer service). They
                offer a discount for customers who make verifiable addresses
                available as part of the checkout process. Francis offers his

                system automatically verifies the ability of the physician to
                write prescriptions, as well as Bob's insurance coverage.
                When Bob arrives to pick up his medication, iPharmacy

                marital status nor his social security number, as those are
                neither requested nor required at this clinic. He further marks
                the disclosure as expiring in 30 days - he does not want his
