  <h3>Citizenship by Parentage</h3>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>
Sam wants to claim US citizenship because his mother is American. Sam has a
digital birth certificate from Kenya, where he was born while his Mother was
in the Peace corps. He also has a digital version of his mother's US passport.
Because his mother’s name changed between his birth and the issuance of the
passport, Sam also has a marriage license with her maiden and married names.
Sam is applying for a new passport from the US Secretary of State.
    </p>
    <h4>Distinction</h4>
    <p>
This use case is challenging because the mother’s name changed, by marriage,
between the issuance of the birth certificate and passport.
    </p>
    <h4>Scenario</h4>
    <p>
Sam’s mother emailed him the certificate, license, and passport as independent
<a>Verifiable Credentials</a>. He then creates a <a>verifiable presentation</a>
which includes those credentials, a statement of their relationship to each
other and his relationship to his mother. He then visits the US Secretary of
State website, creates an account, starts the application for a passport, and
uploads his new <a>verifiable presentation</a> as supporting evidence. After
processing the application, Sam is issued both a traditional passport and a
new digital passport.

    <h4>Verifiable Credentials</h4>
    <dl class="dl-horizontal">
      <dt>
Birth Certificate
      </dt>
      <dd>
Establishes relationship to mother with maiden name
      </dd>

      <dt>
Marriage License

      <dd>
Establishes mother's name change
      </dd>

      <dt>
Mother’s Passport

Establishes mother's US citizenship
      </dd>

      <dt>
Sam’s Passport
      </dt>
      <dd>
Establishes Sam is the child in the birth certificate
      </dd>
    </dl>
  
    <h4>Verifiable Presentation</h4>
    <p>
A <a>verifiable presentation</a> which includes those three <a>credentials</a>,
adds his name, photo, and demographic data along with the assertions that &mdash;
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
He is the child in the birth certificate.
      </li>
      <li>
The mother in the birth certificate, the person in the passport, the spouse in
the marriage license are all the same person.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Trust Hierarchy</h4>
    <p>
Sam is legally liable for his claim to the rights of citizenship. The state
department is on the hook for verifying the underlying credentials and Sam’s
<a>claims</a>, including correlating against any additional data they might
already have.
    </p>
    <h4>Threat model</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: Terrorist / Identity fraud.</strong> A bad actor could be
impersonating Sam to attain a passport. Of course, if a bad actor were to be
able to collect the required <a>verifiable credentials</a>&mdash;mother’s
passport, birth certificate, and marriage license, that actor has already
significantly compromised the system.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Identity assurance based on the <a>presentation</a>
and other data, above and beyond what is in the <a>presentation</a> and the
<a>credentials</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Identity assurance based on the contents of the
<a>credentials</a>, potentially with enhanced data embedded in the <a>credentials</a>,
i.e., data not currently in passports, birth certificates, or marriage license.
For example, a biometric template could be embedded in the birth certificate
<a>credential</a> and that template could be used for interactive identity assurance
at the time of submitting the <a>presentation</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: Exposure of private information.</strong>  By storing
potentially compromising information in <a>credentials</a> and sending them
over the network, we are increasing the attack surface for the <a>subjects</a>
of those credentials.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>credentials</a> (once by issuer, every
<a>verifier</a> gets the same encrypted blob)
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>credentials</a> uniquely for each
<a>verifier</a>. This may leak usage data to the <a>issuer</a>, assuming the
<a>holder</a> must ask for a new, encrypted <a>credential</a> for each
<a>verifier</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Blind the <a>credentials</a> uniquely for each
<a>verifier</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>presentation</a> uniquely for each
<a>verifier</a>. No <a>issuer</a> involved.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
