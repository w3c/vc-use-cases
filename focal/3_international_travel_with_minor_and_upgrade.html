  <h3>International Travel with Minor and Upgrade</h3>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>
Malathi is traveling internationally with her 8-month-old son, Anand. His
father, Rajesh, is staying home. Malathi has enough frequent flyer miles to
upgrade the ticket to first class.
    </p>
    <h4>Distinction</h4>
    <p>
This use case is difficult because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
Current US passports do not establish explicit relationship between parent
and child.
      </li>
      <li>
When one parent travels with a minor, the other parent is required to grant
permission for the trip, thus implying guardianship or responsibility.
      </li>
      <li>
The DID or other Digital Identity system replaces the role of the notary in
the paper/physical world
      </li>
      <li>
Credentials must be coordinated between two verifiers (agent and airline) for
two individuals, and a digital coupon is used.
      </li>
      <li>
The relationship of the minor to the non-traveling parent must be established,
in order for the permission to be considered.
      </li>
      <li>
In the minor's passport case, the <a>subject</a> is not the <a>holder</a> of
the <a>verifiable credential</a>. The <a>holder</a> of the passport is a
parent, not the minor.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Scenario</h4>
    <p>
Malathi obtains permission from Rajesh stating she is allowed to take the baby
out of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
Prior to booking the trips, Malathi visits HappyAir.com to request an upgrade
to first class. HappyAir issues a <a>verifiable credential</a> redeemable for
a first class upgrade on an international flight.
    </p>
    <p>
She books the plane tickets through her travel agent who adds the lap child
to the ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
HappyAir verifies that Malathi has a signed statement from Anand’s other
parent stating that she may exit the country with him.

    <h4>Verifiable Presentation</h4>
    <p>
Submitted to HappyAir, includes Malathi and Anand's passport, assertion of
permission, birth certificate and Frequent Flyer coupon.
    </p>

    <h4>Trust Hierarchy</h4>

Malathi is liable for her claim of parentage as well as securing right to
admission for herself and her son at their destination (visa may be required).

      <li>
Malathi and Rajesh are both liable for attestation of permission to fly with
Anand without the other parent.
      </li>
      <li>
Malathi is liable for the cost of her ticket and her son’s ticket.
      </li>
      <li>
The agency is liable for issuing valid tickets and for verifying the
credentials provided by the travelers.
      </li>
      <li>
The airline is liable for issuing tickets and, ultimately, fulfilling the
terms of travel
      </li>
      <li>
The airline is liable for accepting the upgrade coupons at ticketing.
      </li>
      <li>
The airline is liable for verifying the credentials in the birth certificate
match the credentials in the permission letter.
      </li>
      <li>
The check-in agent, TSA agent, and passport control at the destination are
liable for identity assurance at various points of travel, using information
contained in the <a>verifiable credentials</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Threat model</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: Stolen Key.</strong> Malathi steals Rajesh’s key in order to
fake travel permission. (Kidnapping her own kids and fleeing Rajesh.)
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Rajesh could store his key with a trusted third
party, such as an attorney.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Rajesh could use a hardware wallet with pin or
biometric.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Rajesh could use a passphrase on his key
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: Stolen Key 2</strong> Ticket purchaser has Malathi’s
<a>credentials</a>, impersonating her to purchase a ticket. This could enable
a third-party kidnapping.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Travel permission can be restricted to specific
date and or trip minimizing abuse potential.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Embed identifying characteristics or biometric into
the credentials so that verifiers can independently verify the <a>subject</a>
in front of them is the <a>subject</a> in the <a>credential</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Malathi could use a hardware wallet with pin or
biometric.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Malathi could use a passphrase on her key
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: Exposure of private information.</strong> By storing
potentially compromising information in credentials and sending them over the
network, we are increasing the attack surface for the <a>subjects</a> of those
credentials.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>claims</a> (once by <a>issuer</a>;
every <a>verifier</a> gets the same encrypted blob)
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>claims</a> uniquely for each
<a>verifier</a>. This may leak usage data to the <a>issuer</a>, assuming the
<a>holder</a> must ask for a new, encrypted <a>credential</a> for each
<a>verifier</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Blind the <a>claims</a> uniquely for each
<a>verifier</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Encrypt the <a>presentation</a> uniquely for each
<a>verifier</a>. No issuer involved
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Threat: Stolen coupon</strong> Rajesh falsifies the upgrade coupon.
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> HappyAir signs the coupon with secure credentials.
          </li>
          <li>
<strong>Response:</strong> Travel agent verifies the coupon through a
distributed status registry, verifying it is still valid
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
