    <h3>Exchange of Electronic Certificate of Origin to facilitate Cross Border Trade</h3>
    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>
        This use case has been provided by <a href="https://www.tradetrust.io/" rel="nofollow">TradeTrust</a>, launched
        by Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), a statutory board in the Singapore government.
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, cross-border trade and transport of goods take place on the basis of many documents and processes that
        are paper-based (hence manual), time-consuming, and resource-intensive process for all stakeholders. Another
        downside of such paper-based processes is that there is no easy way to verify the accuracy and authenticity of
        the trade documents. This results in inefficiencies and delays as the time required to process such paper
        documents far exceeds the actual time taken for the physical movement of goods.
        <a href=" https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/travel-logistics-and-infrastructure/our-insights/the-multi-billion-dollar-paper-jam-unlocking-trade-by-digitalizing-documentation">
        According to a study by McKinsey in 2022</a>, documentation for a single shipment can require up to 50 sheets of
        paper that are exchanged with up to 30 different stakeholders.

    <p>
        One of the core documents is a Certificate of Origin (CO), which is commonly used to attest that a product
        originates from a particular country. The standards and guidelines for the CO are
        <a href="https://iccwbo.org/business-solutions/certificates-of-origin/">defined by the International Chamber of
        Commerce</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Distinction</h4>
    <p>
        Existing trade documents are typically printed hard copies secured with wet ink stamps. These documents are
        susceptible to forgery and manipulation. A digital verifiable document would allow for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Assurance that the document has not been tampered with.<li>
        <li>Assurance that the document was issued by a particular Issuer<.li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As these trade documents are shared across different parties in a long chain that may cross many borders,
        the holders of these documents may want control over what information is shared downstream. A shipper may choose
        to selectively redact commercially sensitive information (such as suppliers' names or products' pricing) before
        sharing it onto the next receiving party. This is based on a lossy selective redaction, removing the need to
        re-issue 'a version sans the commercially sensitive information'.
    </p>
    <h4>Actors</h4>
    <p>
        Using an electronic Certificate of Origin (eCO) as an example of a digital document that is issued via the
        TradeTrust framework, below are the typical actors involved in its processing.
    </p>
    <h5>Customs Administration or duly licensed parties like Chambers of Commerce</h5>
    <p>
        Customs Administration and/or Chamber of Commerce are the typical authorities responsible for producing an eCO.
        It is typically required by importers/buyers to claim tariff exemptions from the importing customs authority or
        to provide assurance that the goods are indeed from a particular country. It is provided to importers/buyers by
        the exporters/sellers whom they buy from and often used in financing arrangements with banks.
    </p>
    <h5>Bank</h5>
    <p>
        In cross-border trade, sometimes buyers and sellers may arrange for trade financing services to mitigate the
        risks of non-payment or non-delivery. Banks and other Financial Institutions are often engaged as intermediaries
        to mitigate these risks using financing instruments such as a Letter of Credit (L/C). A L/C is applied for by
        the Buyer and will specify a list of trade documents that the Banks will need to sight and verify on behalf of
        their clients. One of the often-required documents can be an eCO.
    </p>
    <h5>Importer/Buyer</h5>
    <p>
        An Importer/Buyer is the party who purchases and receives products from the seller. If there is a Free Trade
        Agreement between the importing country and the goods’ origin country, the Importer can provide the eCO during
        importation clearance procedures to obtain tariff exemptions for the goods.
    </p>
    <h5>Exporter/Seller</h5>
    <p>
        An Exporter/Seller is the party who sells and transports products to his buyer. The Exporter is the party who
        applies for the eCO from the Customs Administration or duly licensed parties like Chambers of Commerce within
        the exporting country, upon the request of the Importer.
    </p>
    <h5>Issuer</h5>
    <p>
        A Customs Administration and/or Chamber of Commerce are the typical authorities responsible for issuing an eCO.
    </p>
    <h5>Subject</h5>
    <p>
        The eCO attests that the origin of the goods is a particular country. It is used to claim tariff exemptions from
        the importing customs authority or to provide assurance that the goods are indeed from a particular country.
    </p>
    <h5>Holder</h5>
    <p>
        The eCO can be held by the Importer (and/or their appointed customs broker) and presented to the importing
        country’s customs administration for import tariff exemption if there is an in-force Free Trade Agreement
        between the goods’ origin country and the importing country. The eCO can also be held by the Exporter and Banks
        for trade financing purposes.
    </p>
    <h5>Verifier</h5>
    <p>
        The eCO is verified by the importing country’s Custom Authority during the importation of goods. It is also
        verified by Banks if the Exporter and/or Importer has financing arrangements that call for it. It is also
        verified by the importer to assure that the goods originated from the expected country.
    </p>
    <h4>Validation Requirements</h4>
    <p>
        Document verification can be initiated by invoking the open-sourced verification library, or via the trusted
        verification portals which run the open-sourced verification library.
