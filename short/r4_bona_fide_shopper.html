  David owns a restaurant and has registered with a low cost wholesaler to purchase provisions in bulk. The wholesaler has
  issued a credential to David, to prove that he is entitled to enter the warehouse in order to purchase goods that are
  not available to the general public. The credential is marked "non-transferable" to stop David passing the credential to
  his friends to allow them to purchase low cost provisions.
