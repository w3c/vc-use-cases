  E.3 Transferring schools
</dt>
<dd>
  Rocky is an undergraduate student at Wossamotta U. His school
  provides a
  <a>credential repository</a> service to all students and alumni, so
  he chooses
  to use it. In his third year, Rocky decides to transfer to
  Moosylvania Tech.
  They do not offer a service, but he does not want to continue to use
  the
  service of his old (and now rival school) so he moves his
  <a>credentials</a> to the
  service offered by his bank without needing to have them reissued.
