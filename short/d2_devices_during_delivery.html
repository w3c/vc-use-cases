    As the fan controller leaves the factory, additional
    <a>verifiable credentials</a> are issued by Vince, a systems
    engineer at VAR
    Resellers, as he verifies the manufacturer's configuration matches
    the
    <a>verifiable credentials</a> accompanying the device. He then
    installs a
    software package specific to Modern Office Spaces needs and issues
    <a>verifiable credentials</a> that establish evidence of
    possession by VAR
    Resellers and the software additions Vince made to the device.

    Finally, upon delivery to Sam, the end customer, the
    <a>verifiable credentials</a> show that the fan controller has
    been securely
    handled and contains the correct features and certifications.
