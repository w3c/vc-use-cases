  Francis has found the perfect pair of shoes. When processing orders,
  Giant Shoe
  Company wants to be certain that his shipping address is accurate
  (inaccurate
  addresses are very expensive in terms of customer service). They
  offer a
  discount for customers who make verifiable addresses available as
  part of the
  checkout process. Francis offers his certificate and gets the
  perfect shoes for
  even less than he expected.
