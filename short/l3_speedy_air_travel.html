  L.3 Speedy air travel
</dt>
<dd>
  Security for air travel is more and more rigorous, requiring more
  and more
  time to validate each passenger. Ivan has a collection of
  <a>verifiable credentials</a> that are assembled into his air travel
  <em>Identity Profile</em>. When Ivan needs to pass through a
  security
  checkpoint at his airport, he presents this profile before entering
  the
  line. Because his identification can be immediately and
  automatically
  verified, he is permitted to skip the long line and go straight to
  the
  metal detector.
