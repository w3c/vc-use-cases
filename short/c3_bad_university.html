  Jane was issued a certificate by BigTraining Co., indicating that
  she was a
  trained Project Manager. It was later discovered that BigTraining
  Co. was not
  actually training anyone, and their organization's certificate was
  revoked via
  the US Department of Education's Accreditation Database. Jane's
  credential is
  therefore invalid, and prospective employers will be aware of this
  when they
  check her certifications.
