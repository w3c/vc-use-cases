  Asako just passed the final test to receive a drivers license. As
  she is still
  a new driver, and may be pulled over for a traffic violation, she
  would like
  to receive a <a>credential</a> that asserts a <a>claim</a> that she
  has right
  to drive a car. She requests a credential from the certifying
  authority
  (<a>issuer</a>) that she can use to prove to the officer
  (<a>credential verifier</a>) that her <a>claim</a> is valid.
