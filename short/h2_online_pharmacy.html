  iPharmacy receives a prescription for Bob electronically from a
  local clinic.
  It includes a certificate about the physician that issued the
  prescription as
  well as one about Bob. iPharmacy's system automatically verifies the
  ability
  of the physician to write prescriptions, as well as Bob's insurance
  coverage.
  When Bob arrives to pick up his medication, iPharmacy further
  correlates his
  identity with the certificate, thereby improving the end-to-end
  accountability
  of their system.
