  Jason is looking for a new primary care physician. His health
  provider
  includes information on their web site about the physicians they
  have on
  staff, including <a data-lt="claim">verifiable credentials</a> about
  their
  education, board certification, and continuing education. Jason can
  verify
  these credentials and be confident that his new physician satisfies
  his
  requirements.
