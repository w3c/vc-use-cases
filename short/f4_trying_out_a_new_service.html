  <udef>F.4 Trying out a new service</udef>

<dd>
  Nikita has several accounts with BigBank, as well as a brokerage
  account with
  WallStreetCo. She had placed all of her <a>credentials</a> in a
  <a>credential repository</a> at BigBank that came free when she
  opened her
  accounts. WallStreetCo is now offering a new <a>repository</a> that
  has an
  interface she thinks she will prefer. Nikita copies her
  <a>credentials</a> from
  BigBank into the repository at WallStreetCo to experiment with their
  service,
  but continues to use the service from BigBank while she is testing.
