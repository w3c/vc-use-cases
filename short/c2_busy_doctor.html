  Barney was a board-certified physician, but he ran out of time to
  complete
  his continuing education requirements and his certification lapsed.
  Since the
  board can revoke his certification, <a>credential verifiers</a> will
  automatically be aware that he can no longer issue prescriptions or
  perform
  medical procedures.
