  John opens a checking account at Big Bank Co and is issued a
  <a>verifiable credential</a> indicating that the account exists,
  that the bank
  verified John's identity, and that John has access to the account.
  Some time
  later, John is moving to a new city and decides to close that
  account. Big
  Bank Co needs to revoke that credential as part of their normal account
  closing
  process.
