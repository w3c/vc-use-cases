  Tom is a frequent international traveler. In order to speed
  processing
  through immigration check points, he applies for a digital passport
  from his
  governmental authority. After satisfying background check
  requirements, the
  authority issues Tom an electronic version of his passport. This
  version is
  verifiable and retains a history of all the places he visits so that
  immigration officials can quickly and easily evaluate his
  suitability as a
  visitor to their country. Once they are satisfied, they will
  automatically
  add the details of this new visit to Tom's passport.
