  Jane is opening an account at MidBank in Finland. As part of that
  process,
  the bank asks her to provide two from a variety of possible sources
  to confirm
  her identity &mdash; a so-called &quot;Know Your Customer&quot;
  check. She
  selects government-supplied <a>verifiable credentials</a> that
  confirm she
  receives postal mail at a certain address and that she has a
  national ID card.
  Confirming these allows the bank to open her account and be
  confident in her
  identity when she conducts transactions.

  Now that the account is open, Jane is issued a digitally-signed
  <a>credential</a> for her checking account at MidBank. This
  <a>credential</a>
  verifies that Jane has an account at MidBank and has access to her
  associated checking account. It is issued to a controlled 
  identifier over which Jane has demonstrated proof-of-control.
  When presented, Jane again demonstrates proof-of-control over that 
  identifier to give the verifier confidence that the current holder
  presenting the credential, is in fact, the original recipient of 
  the credential. Since MidBank (and all banks in Finland) are
  required to perform &quot;Know Your Customer&quot; checks on 
  accounts, this credential can also be used as sufficient 
  verification by other financial institutions. This helps Jane 
  assure destination banks that she is verified, thereby
  allaying concerns about misdirected transactions and money 
  laundering.
