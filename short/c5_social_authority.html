  Josie is a healthcare worker that has created a profile on a
  professional
  social network to make herself readily available for new
  opportunities in the
  workforce. She lists her employment history and qualifications
  including degrees,
  certificates, and digital badges. The website requests verification
  of her
  <a>credentials</a> in order for her qualifications to be visible
  when she
  posts messages. Josie authorizes the sharing of the relevant
  <a>credentials</a> with
  the website, and the site verifies and validates them before allowing Josie to
  expose them.

  "Freedom?" is an online forum that encourages free discussion about
  issues
  controversial in Freedonia. The forum allows users to register
  anonymous
  accounts, but it also allows users to obtain badges based upon
  real-world
  certifications. Paula has been certified as an aid worker, and
  wishes that
  information to be marked on her posts. She shares her certificate
  with the
  forum, but limits it to only verifying that she is the <a>holder</a>
  of the
  certificate, that she is the <a>subject</a> of it, and that she is
  an aid
  worker. In this way she maintains her anonymity in this
  controversial forum
  while still being able to assist her fellow countrymen.
